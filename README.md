# Rock-Paper-Scissors-Little-Brawl-
Rock paper scissors (also known as scissors rock paper, paper rock scissors and scissors paper stone) is a hand game usually played between two people, in which each player simultaneously forms one of three shapes among (Rock, Paper, &amp; Scissors) with an outstretched hand. But in this version of game I didn't use any Graphical User Interface but just a simple function to make the concept of logic of the Game Crystal. It is just the Beginner Level of code in which i used the random function to select the opponent and at he end the winner is printed with the description of the score board with the leading points.
